# Edos.ec

Edos.ec is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into a static site whenever this repository is pushed to GitHub.

## Creating The Next EdoSec Meetup

To generate next month's EdoSec page, run the following commands:

	./rake
	git add .
	git commit -m "New Meetup"
	git push origin

This script will create a page for the next EdoSec, which is usually the Second Wednesday of the month.

## Other Meetups

If you coordinate another meetup, feel free to copy this and use it for your own monthly meetup site.
